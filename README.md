# Working with US EIA 861 data

This repository is intended to provide tools for accelerating the preprocessing of EIA 861 Data.

This repository provides a script to download, unzip, extract and convert the Sales to Ultimate Customers (previously file2) .xls/.xlsx files across several years (2001 to present) to a series of csv files.

A second script will unify the columns, append the files and write a single csv file. 

Some simple functions will be provided to process some basic economic measures, like market concerntration and HHI.
